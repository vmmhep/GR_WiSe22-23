    "1. Working in the frame of the Earth (E), it is easy to see that the outward and inward journeys take the same amount of time (since the two spaceships travel at the same speed $v$). Suppose that the spaceships meet at time $t_E$, then the total elapsed time on Earth is $T_E = 2 t_E$. For the first leg of the journey, the time elapsed on the clock on the outgoing spaceship is $t_E / \\gamma$ where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2}$. Similarly, after the handoff the time elapsed on the ingoing clock is $t_E/\\gamma$. Adding these two gives $2t_E/\\gamma = T_I$. We then have the relation $T_I = T_E/\\gamma$. \n",

    "1. We need to show that we can remove the effects of gravity by going to an accelerating frame. This way, it follows that the effects of gravity cannot be distinguished from acceleration. Since we are only discussing the motion of particles, it suffices to show that this is true for Newton's second law. If we consider a system that is acted upon by gravitational ($\\vec{F}_g$) and non-gravitational ($\\vec{F}_{ng}$) forces, then we have\n",

Different substances have masses that arise in different proportion from (i) the masses of subatomic particles (neutrons, electrons and protons) and (ii) the binding energies that hold these subatomic particles together (e.g. strong or electromagnetic binding energies). The ratio of gravitational to inertial mass will be equal for all these substances only if it is equal for each of the constituents.
